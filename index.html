            <p>Welcome to Hearts of Love. We are a student-led organization formed to help the world be a better place.
                Here any skill can be useful as long as you're willing to work hard to make our world a better place for everyone!
                <br>
                We are Hearts of Love and our mission is to help our community become a better place by promoting kindness, teamwork,
                responsibility, and proactiveness in order to assist the homeless and orphanages that exist in our world. We want to be helpers
                not bystanders, by providing assistance to the homeless, disadvantaged children, orphanages and senior citizens in terms of 
                improving their living standards as well as necessities that may be necessary for a healthy lifestyle such as access to food, water
                , shelter, education, resources, and more...through a continuous cycle of events, fundraisers, charity programs, and much more!
                We also plan to create media advertisements and monthly newletters about our cause and to bring people together in order to help 
                out these people in our world and community!
